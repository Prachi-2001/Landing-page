# README.md for Next.js Landing Page

## Project Overview

This README.md provides comprehensive documentation for a project where we have designed a landing page using Next.js. The landing page serves as the entry point for our web application, and this document aims to provide insights into the project's goals, design decisions, challenges faced, installation instructions, usage guidance, contribution guidelines, and licensing information.

Our landing page project is built on Next.js, a popular React framework, and serves as the first impression of our web application. It is essential to document the key aspects of this project to ensure that the development process is transparent and that team members and contributors have a clear understanding of the project.

## Design Decisions

When designing our landing page using Next.js, I made a series of important design decisions that influenced the project's overall direction. Here's a summary of our design choices:

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js, typescript, Tailwind CSS.

- **Design Style**: Our design style is centered around a minimalistic and user-friendly approach. Converted given figma file into a reusable componenets without hard coding anything.

- **Performance Optimization**: I developed this responsive landing page by storing data in data.js file to don't hardcode it by following best practices. Makde resuable components with a modular approach of designing layout.

- **User Experience (UX)**: User experience is a top priority. We conducted usability tests, and based on user feedback, we integrated features to enhance navigation, minimize friction, and improve overall satisfaction.
